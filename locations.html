					<h2> <i> The Sword Coast - Forgotten Realms </i> </h2>
						<p> The Sword Coast of the Forgotten Realms is one of the most popular D&D settings in recent decades, and is the home of such adventures as <i> The Lost Mines of Phandelver</i> & <i>Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk</i>, <i>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</i>, and <i>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</i>.</p>
						<p> In this homebrew variant of the setting, the Sword Coast has recently come to the end of a massive 700-year war between Lycans and Lycan Hunters, which left vast swarthes of the country devastated. Despite major rebuilding efforts in the last 25 years of peace, several large areas of the land are scarred and broken from the conflict - to say nothing of the people who fought and died in the war itself. Many events canon to the history of the Sword Coast have still taken place in this world - most recently and notably, the Forge of Spells from <i> The Lost Mines of Phandelver</i> was recovered by a party including NPC Sildar Hallwinter, who earned his promotion in the Sword Guards through the act. </p>

					<h2> <i> Dresden Keep </i> </h2>
						<p> The Dresden family keep is the ancestral home of the Dresden family, who had lived their for many centuries - possibly even before the Great Lycan War began - until all the surviving family members were believed to have vanished a little over a century prior to our adventure.</p>
						<p>Recommended to the party by Sildar Hallwinter, in recent years the keep has been overrun by undead creatures. In clearing the base, the party discovered a ritual circle in the basement housing a trapped Beholder Zombie, who disintegrated Endrie before falling to the party's blades. The Keep was temporarily renamed after Endrie until his resurrection, and the reclamation of the Keep by the last surviving Dresden. </p>

					<h2> <i> Neverwinter </i> </h2>
						<p> Known as <b>The Jewel of the North</b>, Neverwinter is a major city on the Sword Coast. In this version, the city is home to the Headquarters of the Sword Guards, replacing the canonical  <i>Cloak Tower</i> location in the city. It is therefore the home base of Sildar Hallwinter and his allies within the Sword Guards, and Dresden Keep is a short ride outside the city limits. Despite falling to a volcanic eruption in 1451 DR, the city has been rebuilt and fortified to defend against all imaginable forces from outside the city - but unfortunately, not all within want the city to stand forever. </p>

					<h2> <i> Waterdeep </i> </h2>
						<p> <b>The City of Splendors</b>, Waterdeep is one of the most influential and powerful cities on the Sword Coast, and were it not for the politics of the city would have easily housed the Sword Guard Headquarters itself. As it is, the city holds one of the most influential Sword Guard outposts of the organisation, as well as many key locations in the campaign. These locations include <b>Rowan's Crypt</b>, <b>The Church of Selune</b>, and the <b>Denari Family Alchemy Store</b>.</p>

					<h2> <i> Baldur's Gate </i> </h2>
						<p>Also called the <b>City of Blood</b>, Baldur's Gate is perhaps most well known today for the multi-award-winning Game of the Year <i>Baldur's Gate 3</i>, where most of the game is dedicated to reaching the city and stopping an illithid threat.</p>
						<p>In this version of Baldur's Gate, the city is much more peaceful, holding a tentative truce with the powerful Grazak'tel clan of werewolves who rule south of the city - at least until one side has accumulated enough power to wipe the other out - and remaining Illithid free. The city is also home to the <b>Ye Olde Confectionary Company</b> factory, which mass produces waffle pots for distribution across the entire Forgotten Realms.</p>

						<h2> <i> Vulcan's Reach </i> </h2>
							<p> A city homebrewed specifically for the second act of Claws &#38; Steel (<i>Betwixt the Stars</i>), Vulcan's Reach is known as <b>The City Adrift</b>. Floating through space in a void between the Astral Seas, Vulcan's Reach is a flying city built and maintained by giants as a preservation effort of the civilised races in space. The city acts as a hub for Wildspace Spelljammers (space-faring adventurers with their own ships), and temporarily hosts the party when they are sent to the Astral Sea by an unknowingly booby-trapped Bag of Holding. </p>
