						<img src="images/MC/Calypsa.png" alt="Calypsa" width="300" height="300">

						<h2> <i> Calypsa Hallwinter-Bolt </i> </h2>
							<p> In her original form, the changeling Calypsa was a statue in the garden of the Dawnbreaker Guild of lycan hunters, an independant guild dedicated to continuing the 700-year war with lycankind. Twelve soldiers gave their lives to raise their Weapon from the Void, Alterrah, but the process was complicated when she was unknowingly granted a soul by her Warlock patron. Raised since by the Daggerford Guildmaster, Zeldail Bolt, Calypsa embraced the way of the Weapon as an assassin until Sword Guard Captain Sildar Hallwinter, invited her with him to the Gathering of Peace.</p>

						<h2> <i> Endrie Grazak'tel </i> </h2>
							<p> The bugbear son of Chief Kolgura of the Grazak'tel clan of werewolves, Endrie was an immediate disapointment to his father when it was revealed he was not a bloodthirsty and violent man. Choosing instead to study the arcane arts, he was subsequently betrayed by his father at the ancestral well of his people, an act that accidentally imbued him with an ancient power as a Cleric. Having died and been resurrected well over a hundred times since by an unethical Witch, Endrie's latest ressurection has seen him awaken in the body of a clone with the power of the Arcane Storm, a new deity called Myrsky, at his command.</p>

						<h2> <i> Briseis Torment </i> </h2>
							<p> As a tiefling child living on the outskirts of Amphail, Briseis lost her entire family when an entity known as the Beast slew them all, leaving only her barely alive as she floated down the bloodied river to Waterdeep. Raised by the church of Selune until she could join the Sword Guards, Briseis too the Paladin's path of Vengeance, allowing no man, beast, or waffle pot to stand in her way - with the support of her demonic ancestor, Asmodeus, the lord of the hells. Despite occasionally being overtaken with overwhelmingly violent urges at the sight of lycans, Briseis has forged a friendship with her party, sharing in their victories and mouring their losses. </p>

						<h2> <i> Arathir </i> </h2>
							<p> As the former Hammer of a violent, bloodthirsty society in the Shadowfell, the shadar'kai grew sick of the destruction he inflicted on his own citizens. Escaping his own realm with the aid of the rival Fey family within the region, Arathir made his way to the Material Plane for a more peaceful existence - until the rising Paragon threat brought the fight to him. Having thrown a drake in front of the party's vehicle, fighting alongside them to protect his new home lead to an awakening of lycanthropic potential when he became a werebat, and subsequently joined the party to end the threat and save his new home. </p>

						<h2> <i> Aeovar Denari (Inactive) </i> </h2>
							<p> A veteran of the Sword Guards and master of a potioneer's shop in Waterdeep, Aeovar's life has been filled with love and loss, losing both his wife to a sickness and his son to the job. The latter sent him down a depressive path of drinking and desperation, seeking mystical metallic plants with unusual properties in an attempt to resurrect his lost child. Allying with the party for a time to hunt down the woman he believed murdered his child, he soon joined her fight to save the realms when he learnt that she had attempted to save his son, who died from a violent attack from the Beast of Amphail. </p>

						<h2> <i> Nero Andromeda (Deceased)</i> </h2>
							<p> A warforged Bard and former Zhentarim slave, Nero's life was seldom easy. Returning home one day to find his creator's house burned and his automaton brothers and sisters missing, he was 'reclamed' by the Zhentarim thieves' guild for a debt and put to work. Managing to escape, Nero stumbled into an unknown forest and bitten by a wild lycan, transforming him into a feral Werecrocodile. Accepted into a clan who taught him to control his abilities, Nero joined the party at the Gathering of Peace and remained a member until his demise at the hands of an Avatar of Death, unknowingly pulled from the legendary and dangerous Deck of Many Things.</p>

						<img src="images/NPC/ASildar-Hallwinter.png" alt="Sildar Hallwinter" width="250" height="250">

						<h2> <i> Sildar Hallwinter </i> </h2>
							<p> A former soldier who enlisted in the final years of the lycan war, Sildar was inspired by the life and death of his older sister, Allison, to join the cause. After the war was over he took up with the Sword Guards to keep the peace, and later retired with honours. Joining the expedition into the Lost Mines of Phandelver at the behest of his friend, Gundren Rockseeker, Sildar became one of the "Forge Five" who unearthed the mythical dwarven forge, an accomplishment that earned him the position of Captain of Practical Operations of the Sword Guards. </p>

						<h2> <i> Rowan Nightshade </i> </h2>
							<p> A necromancer who lives in the graveyard of Waterdeep, Rowan is surprisingly friendly, given his profession. While he is often ostracised from the rest of Waterdeep, after accidentally unleashing a revenant upon the population of the city some years prior, he takes care of the dead with abilities beyond that of a normal sorcerer. In addition to freeing trapped souls from around the realms, he is part of a secret and unnamed society that works to defend the realms from threats beyond mortal comprehension - including The Oncoming Storm, and Mendax and his Paragons.</p>

						<h2> <i> Core Hull </i> </h2>
							<p> Formerly a warforged warlock, Core Saber accepted a quest to seek and destroy the source of an unknown energy surge operating from near Triboar. Unfortunately, this ended poorly for him when he was decapitated. The party brough his sentiant head along with them, and discovered the source of the energy was a pulsing beacon connected to a large, modified vehicle that did not require horses. Connecting Core Saber's head to the vehicle, he took over its operation and renamed himself Core Hull, acting as the party's transportation ever since. </p>

						<h2> <i> Jal Horden </i> </h2>
							<p> An unknown visitor from an unknown, and entirely different, universe, Jal Horden was accidentally summoned by Endrie when he pulled <b> The Knight </b> from the Deck of Many Things on the Floating Asteroid of Zargoth. Since then he has remained at the party's side and assisted in their battles, revealing that this is not the first universe he has visited - and when he perishes, it will not be the first time he has died. If he is to be believed, it is possible that he may have visited this realm before, as the Guildmaster of the seafaring guild, the Ships of Wrath, is named Renly Horden.</p>

						<img src="images/NPC/EHansenMendax.png" alt="Mendax Dresden" width="250" height="250">

						<h2> <i> Mendax Dresden </i> </h2>
							<p> The last descendant of the Dresden family, Mendax wormed his way back into his family's keep under the guise of <b>Steward Hansen Prast</b>, the caretaker of the home while the party attended to business away. The disguise gave him the run of his ancestral home while he worked through his Paragons to raise the Spheres of Power and collect the artifacts he needed for his family's ritual, while manipulating the party and keeping them away from his true objectives. There is no limit to how far Mendax will go for his aims, whether it's taking a Hellfire Orb to the face or casting the party from the Material Plane to the Astral Sea. He has been unseen since the party returned from space, but his Paragons are hard at work spreading their influence and targetting major powers across the coast. </p>

						<img src="images/NPC/EZeldail-Bolt.png" alt="Zeldail Bolt" width="250" height="250">

						<h2> <i> Zeldail Bolt </i> </h2>
							<p> The Guildmaster of the Daggerford Chapter of the Sword Guards and old rival to Sildar Hallwinter, Zeldail is the man who trained Calypsa into a living weapon after the dissolution of the Dawnbreaker Guild. Furious at Sildar for taking the Captain's position, a role he believes is rightfully his, he has declared a Civil War within the Sword Guards, abandoning Calypsa for his aims. She is not the first child he has forsaken - Sildar revealed that just a few years after the war ended Zeldail struck down his own son, Linek Bolt, after he gained lycanthropic abilities. Sildar hoped to save Calypsa from Zeldail as he once rescued Linek, training him to become <b>Grayson of Secomber</b> under Zeldail's nose. As well as a Paladin, Zeldail has taken a Warlock's Pact with Asmodeus, Lord of the Hells, for power.</p>
