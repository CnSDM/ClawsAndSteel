					<p><i> “The world, as we have always known it, is not safe.<br>
						Ours is a time of chaos. For centuries, wars have raged between the law of the wild, and the rule of so-called ‘civilisation’. There are those who have sought to beat back the natural order, and preserve the development of growing technologies and arcane study, the comprehension and craving for knowledge and sanctuary. Those who protect this way of life, of the future, and will raise steel in its defence, are known as Hunters.<br>
						And there are those who embrace the law of the wild, the survivors of the natural order, and work to preserve its existence against the growing threat of civilization. Those who protect the wilds from men, who exist in both worlds, able to blend into the civilized world as representatives of the land, sea, and sky, are known as the Lycanfolk.<br>
						The wars raged for centuries until finally, some 30 years ago, an accord was reached - to protect both worlds, the Hunters would ensure civilisation did not grow to consume the wilds, and the Lycanfolk would ensure the supernatural beasts of the wilds were kept in check. It is a tenuous peace - at times, the supernatural would bleed into mortal territory, much as the greed of mortals would threaten the wilds. But with this arrangement we, as all do, hope for peace.<br>
						But we are not foolish. Each of you lives in one of two worlds, which cross and intersect in volatile and violent ways. And in each of your regards, you have the most sacred of duties - to remember. Because of everyone, you must know most. Remember most. Understand most.<br>
						That the world, as we have always known it, is not safe.” </i></p>

						<p> The Pentannual Gathering of Peace is an event held every five years since the end of the Great Lycan War, as a day of rememberence and mourning for the war, and a celebration that it is over. When the sixth gathering, 30 years after the end of the war, is attacked by a combination of mutated wereling creatures and silver automatons, four wards - the Hunters Calypsa and Briseis, and the lycans Endrie and Nero - join forces to destroy the creatures.</p>
						<p> Sensing an opportunity, the Sword Guard Captain Sildar Hallwinter and the Werebear Leader Theltin Parakas offer the group the opportunity to become part of a new experiment: to form their own party to foster peace between Lycans and Hunters. Together, though with some loss, they clear out Dresden Keep as a base of operations and begin to investigate reports of a new series of threats across the Sword Coast tying back to the deistic Spheres of Power, and unearth the threats known as Mendax and the Paragons.</p>

	<h2> The Great Lycan War </h2>

						<p> The Great Lycan War began so long ago, nobody truly remembers why it started - not even the oldest of elves, who are known to live most of a millenia. History says the war started over 700 years ago, and since then the effects have been catastrophic. In an attempt to use magic to wipe out the lycans, the Spellplague took place and destroyed magic across the realm for a decade, killing the goddess of magic before she was ressurrected. On the other hand, the lycan populations split into the savage and the civilised, fighting their own skirmishes about how to win the war. Centuries later, the bravery of soldiers and a final need for cooperation paved the way for the Werebear leader, Theltin Parakas, to reach a ceasefire with the Hunter's Association, finally ushering in an era of peace. Since then, the sides have mostly kept to themselves and their own domains, with some exceptions - namely, the violent and bloodthirsty Grazak'tel clan, and the war-focussed independant Dawnbreaker Guild. </p>

						<p>The Sword Guard operates primarily in place of the canonical Lords' Alliance faction of the Sword Coast, but with a few differences. The Sword Guards are responsible for the safeguarding of the "civilised cities" from attacks from extraplanar entities and the angier lycan population of the Realm. The Sword Guards were founded around 30 years prior to the campaign at the disbandment of the Hunter's Association, which was the main military force fighting the lycanthropes. </p>
						<p>The Sword Guards have three distinct districts - the mainland, run by the Sword Guards proper, the northern territory of Icewind Dale, run by the Icewind Picks, and the Sea of Swords, run by the Ships of Wrath. </p>

		<h2> The Dresdens </h2>

				<section>

					</center>
						<p> The Dresdens are an ancient Faerunian family with history going back centuries, since long before the war. While living in the ancestral home, the living members of the family in 1388 attempted an arcane ritual to grant themselves dominance over the Spheres of Power, a ritual which seemingly wiped out the family line - until the last heir of the lineage, Mendax Dresden, emerged in the modern day.</p>
						<p>There is an old family legend about the Dresdens, which says that an heir named <i>Mendax</i> would rise to power and either fulfil the family legacy, bringing untold riches and glory upon their name, or doom them for eternity. It would appear, with the success of his family's ritual, the present Mendax is on his path to being that heir.</p>

					<img src="images/lore/Spheres.png" alt="Silvanus" width="350" height="350">
					</center>
						<p> The <i> Spheres of Power</i> is the name given to the extranatural forces that have the most influence over the Material Plane of the Sword Coast. Each force has it's own emissary between planes and possesses it's own people who draw on it's power, such as Paladins, Clerics, Warlocks, and Sorcerers.</p>
						<p> The six forces that make up the Spheres of Power are the <b>Dragon</b>, stemming from Tiamat and Bahamut, <b>Fey</b>, from the Feywild, <b>Shadow</b> and <b>Undead</b>, from the Shadowfell, <b>Fiend</b>, from the Nine Hells, and <b>Lycan</b>, from the Faerunian god of the wilds, Silvanus.

		<h2> The Eclipses </h2>

				<section>

					<img src="images/lore/Eclipse.png" alt="The Eclipses" width="350" height="350">
					</center>
						<p> The Eclipses are an order of interdimensional warrior women who guard the walls between the Shadowfell realm of darkness and the Material Plane. While predominantly existing as beings of pure energy, they can manifest themselves in humanoid form in the visions and dreams of their warlocks and warriors. <b>Alterrah</b> is one such Eclipse, the patron of Calypsa's power. She predominantly communicates through an emissary known as <b>The Sharp</b>, a sentient longsword, but can also manifest in her own human form - that of Allison Hallwinter.</p>
